# Contributing to The-Amazing-Ledger
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

We encourage the use of [semantic commit
messages](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) for better understanding of what
is being done in each commit.

We use a changelog based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
We add new entries to it in the commit that makes the changes.

Our versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
